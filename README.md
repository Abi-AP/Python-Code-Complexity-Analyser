Introduction

This project was developed to address the need for a simple, on-the-go tool for coders to analyze the time and space complexity of their Python code. It uses Flask for the backend and integrates advanced static analysis tools to provide precise Big O complexity results.

Features

•	Real-time analysis of Python code snippets

•	Displays time and space complexity in Big O notation

•	User-friendly interface with a modern design

•	Deployed on Heroku for global accessibility

Technologies Used

•	Backend: Python, Flask

•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

•	Static Analysis Tools: big-O-calculator, radon

•	Deployment: Replit

•	Version Control: Git, GitHub
